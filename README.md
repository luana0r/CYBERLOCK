# CYBERLOCK
FL Group.

Hi and welcome to the FL-Groups project!

We are students from Argentina, pursuing careers in Cybersecurity and Programming, with expertise in both areas. Through these projects, we aim to develop skills in web development, including front-end and back-end, using languages such as Python, PHP, HTML, SQL, and more as needed.

The text above represents the first stage of our project. The second part involves developing a software application, specifically a PC and mobile application. Currently, it is an idea in progress, and we will not share any materials until it is realized in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to check out our projects. We hope you like them, and we welcome any suggestions you may have.
